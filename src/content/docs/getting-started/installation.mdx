description: Instructions on how to install and set up the Discord-Luau package.

This guide will walk you though installing the Discord-Luau package into an IDE of your choice, enabling you
to start creating Discord Applications!

:::tip
This guide assumes the following;

- You've set up your environment, if you've not already done this, please take a look at [this guide](/getting-started/environment/)

### Context

The Luau language is yet to find it's true package manager, which makes installing Discord-Luau a little bit more complicated
than other languages..

and in order to keep to some sort of standard for installing this as a package, we've gone for the *dreaded*
[Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) approach.

:::note
If you're aware of a Package Manager that Luau packages can take advantage of, please reach out to us through GitHub issues!

We would LOVE to collaborate and get DiscordLuau onto a Luau package manager.

### Git Submodules

This section will assume you know nothing about Git submodules, *and if so.. oh god forgive me for stress i'm about to cause you.. sorry!*

Jokes aside, Git Submodules are actually a really useful resource for linking git repositories into one another, by doing this, we
allow your code *(which should be a git repository)* to import discord luau *(a git reposoitory)*, and then use this as a package in your
project.

#### Setting up a git repository

Assuming you just have a folder at the moment, and you're in that folder, within your IDE *(I'll be using VSCode as reference)* what
you have is not yet a git repository.

To create a git repository, you'll need to execute the following command in a command line, inside of your project folder:
```bash
git init
```

This should set up a git repository inside of that folder *(if you don't see any new files, or changes, don't worry! Git did create a
`.git` folder, it's normally just hidden by your OS!)*

#### Adding Discord-Luau to your workspace

Assuming you've set up a git repository, add Discord-Luau to your workspace by executing the following in a command line:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/DiscordLuau/discord-luau.git DiscordLuau
```

#### Updating Discord-Luau

Assuming you've set up a git repository, and added Discord-Luau as a submodule, you can update Discord-Luau through the following commands

```bash
cd DiscordLuau
git checkout Master
git pull origin Master
cd ..
```

if we break this down a bit, in our terminal, we're entering the DiscordLuau folder *(which is the git repository for DiscordLuau!)*
then switching from HEAD *(the version you had installed locally)* to `master`, which is the latest version of DiscordLuau that is most updated
and then pulling any changes we don't have, from github, into our repository.

#### I've made changes to Discord-Luau

If you've made changes to Discord-Luau, and you're unable to checkout a different branch, or pull from the remote, i'd suggest
creating a fork of discord-luau, and maintaing that fork.

I will not be going into details on how you'd do that.. one because I suck at git, and two because generally we're going to be going
into more advanced topics that you should learn indepdantly from discord-luau.

*Don't make changes to discord-luau, unless you're comfortable with Git!*

#### Removing Discord-Luau

Yeah.. maybe it's time we switch to a package manager, or maybe you just can't update and you'd rather just re-install discord-luau..

well, you can remove the submodule through the following commands:

```bash
git rm DiscordLuau
```
