title: Environment Setup
description: Instructions on how to set up a healthy environment for a Discord Application
---

This guide will provide a brief overview on how to setup both the [Lune](https://lune-org.github.io/docs) runtime 
as well as several tools that will help you in the production of a DiscordLuau application.

This guide assumes you're a classic Roblox developer that's never looked at software development outside of the Roblox Engine

## Required

The following tools are required to have a healthy environment to build a DiscordLuau application

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a common IDE that DiscordLuau will assume you'll be using, there will be several references to VSCode, or branches alike
VSCode in this guide.

To install Visual Studio Code, please head to their official website, and download the binaries required for your platform;

- https://code.visualstudio.com/

*(From this point on, we expect that you've created a new file system Folder for your discord application,
and have opened that folder in VSCode)*

### Aftman

[Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) is a [toolchain manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain), enabling 
developers to easily download and setup project tooling.

This guide assumes you're going to be using aftman, however, if not - there will be links to documentation to indicate other
installation methods.

#### Installation of Aftman

Please follow the [following guide on how to install the Aftman toolmanager](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

---

### Lune

Lune in a [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system), enabling us to take advantage
of Luau, beyond the Roblox engine, there are some destinct differences from Lune and the compiled Luau binaries though,
the major factor being that Lune provides a standard library.

To learn more about lune, please [head over here](https://lune-org.github.io/docs)

#### Installation of Lune

Installing lune can be done so through Aftman as such:

```bash
aftman add lune-org/lune
```

To verify that Lune has installed correctly, you can execute the following command in a Command Line / Terminal to interact
with the lune CLI:

```bash
lune
```

:::note
If you get an error upon the above Lune command, please ensure that the envrionment variables are setup as per aftman requires - otherwise
your computer won't know where to find Lune!
:::

#### Setup of Lune

Lune installation is not enough for us to fully take advantage of this runtime in our IDE, we also need to setup some of the 
additional rules that Lune requires;

Please follow the guide [linked here](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/getting-started/4-editor-setup)

### Luau-Lsp

[Luau LSP](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp) is a Language server for the Luau programming language, this is going to help make your life easier when both using luau, and 
interacting with DiscordLuau's type interface.

#### Installation of Luau-Lsp

- [VSCode IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp) 
- [VSCodium IDE](https://open-vsx.org/extension/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp)

:::caution
This assumes you have a variant of the Visual Studio Code IDE, if not - then you can install Luau-Lsp through aftman with the following

```bash
aftman install JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp
```

using [this guide](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/blob/main/editors/README.md), you may be able to set up the LSP for whatever your configuration is.

### Git

Git is primarily a version protocol, websites such as GitHub & GitLab is built around this protocol, allowing developers to upload
versioned code to a repository that anyone can visit and access.

We will need to use Git in order to install the Discord-Luau library into your project.

#### Installation of Git

Git can be installed by following [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

:::note
Git isn't an application, but more of a command line tool, if you're not comfortable with using the command line, there are
git clients out there that can simplify the process of using Git!

I'll link [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as reference.
:::

## Not Required

The following tools are nice-to-haves, but by all means can be skipped and/or ignored.

### Selene Linter

[Selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene) allows us to run a [Linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) on our Luau code, this is generally a healthy tool to have if you're going
to be making a large codebase.

#### Installation of Selene

You can install the selene lint through aftman with the following command

```bash
aftman install Kampfkarren/selene
```

### Stylua Formatter

[Stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) allows us to run a [Code Formatter](https://trunk.io/learn/what-is-a-code-formatter-and-why-would-i-want-to-use-one) on our Luau code, this is also quite healthy
if you're going to either be working in a team, or the codebase is going to become quite large.

#### Installation of Stylua

You can install the Stylua formatter through aftman with the following command

```bash
aftman install JohnnyMorganz/StyLua
```

## Conclusion

You should now have the avaliable tools to start developing a discord application in Discord Luau!

The following is a `aftman.toml` file containing all of the above tools, you can compare what you have to this to ensure everything
is correctly installed!

```toml
# This file lists tools managed by Aftman, a cross-platform toolchain manager.
# For more information, see https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman

# To add a new tool, add an entry to this table.
[tools]
lune = "lune-org/lune@0.8.4"
stylua = "JohnnyMorganz/StyLua@0.20.0"
selene = "Kampfkarren/selene@0.27.1"
luau-lsp = "JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp@1.24.1"
```

Additionally, you should also have the following applications avaliable in the command line:

```bash
git -v
```

```bash
aftman -V
```

and finally, you've installed an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code!
